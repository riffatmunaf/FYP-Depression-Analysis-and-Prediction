# 🧠 Depression Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict depression risks using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of survey responses capturing demographic, lifestyle, and psychological factors that may contribute to depression. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of depression based on various input features.

## 🎯 Research Question
Can machine learning models effectively predict the likelihood of depression in individuals based on survey responses covering lifestyle, work/study conditions, and personal history?

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights about depression risk factors.
- Apply **data preprocessing techniques** to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Develop and compare different **machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) to predict depression.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Interpret the results to understand **key contributing factors** to depression risk.

## 🔍 Background
Depression is a growing concern in modern society, impacting individuals across various age groups and professions. Traditional diagnosis methods require clinical evaluations, which can be time-consuming and expensive. This project leverages data-driven techniques to predict depression risks based on self-reported survey data. By identifying key lifestyle and demographic factors, we aim to contribute to **early detection and intervention strategies** for mental health.
